## TO DO ##

** Make find_ones() quieter, less printing, make it more useful by other parts

** Fix / add additional verfiication method, since we dont' support floating point right now, need to 
check to see/avoid having identical numbers in the center points/same cluster.

** possibly automate delta1 and delta2 finding 

** Add floating point fix, ideally 0 - 99 or 7-bits of precision, 7qubits
