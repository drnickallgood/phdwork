Research Notes


** TO DO **

* Expand Tabu Charts for 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100 samples , get graphs
* Tabu Kmeans comparison (DONE) - Do writeup comparing to classical 
* Simulated Annealing kmeans Comparison
* Hybrid BQM Kmeans Comparison
* kmedoids comparison analysis and iterations
* Diff number of clusters , 1, 2, 4, 5
* Diff seed values


* Adaptive solution which allows the use of floating point in the results
* Real life data (Malware MOTIF data set)
    * \# of samples out of specific malware famalies, cluster them
    * See how close we get, MOTIF has ground truth labels or close to it...
