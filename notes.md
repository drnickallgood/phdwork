Research Notes

** Current Status **
  * Changing / modifying delta 2 even down to longer decimal places can actually help this formultaion.



** TO DO **

* Add NMF basics to Chapter 2 dissertation.
* Write math out for NMF solution
* Write math out for Adaptive Formulation using offsets 

* Adaptive solution which allows the use of floating point in the results
    * Tabu
    * Sim Annealing
    * Hybrid BQM


* Real life data (Malware MOTIF data set)
    * \# of samples out of specific malware famalies, cluster them
    * See how close we get, MOTIF has ground truth labels or close to it...


* Expand Tabu Charts for 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100 samples , get graphs


** Tentative Schedule **
