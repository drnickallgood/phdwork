Research Notes

** Current Status **

* Updated dissertation doc, had wrong info in Tabu Kmeans chart
* Working on mathematica notebook for graphs, going to graph kmeans comparisons
    * Inertia, Sil, Homog, Compl, V-measure, Iterations of kmeans
    * Comparing Random, Tabu, SimA, Hybrid processes
* Need to start work on SimA kmeans exp and HybridBQM Exp


** TO DO **

* Expand Tabu Charts for 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100 samples , get graphs
* Graphs (Default, Tabu , Sim , Hybrid )
    * Inertia
    * Silhouette
    * HomoG
    * Compl
    * V-measure
    * Iterations

* Tabu Kmeans comparison (DONE) - Do writeup comparing to classical 
* Tabu kmeans graphs - inertia, silhouette, homog, compl, v-measure
* Simulated Annealing kmeans Comparison
* Hybrid BQM Kmeans Comparison
* kmedoids comparison analysis and iterations
* Diff number of clusters , 1, 2, 4, 5
* Diff seed values


* Adaptive solution which allows the use of floating point in the results
    * Tabu
    * Sim Annealing
    * Hybrid BQM


* Real life data (Malware MOTIF data set)
    * \# of samples out of specific malware famalies, cluster them
    * See how close we get, MOTIF has ground truth labels or close to it...



** Tentative Schedule **

* Experiments done:  Dec 31, 2022
* Dissertation Draft:  March 15, 2023
* Dissertation Defense: April 15, 2023



** Prospective Papers **

* Quantum NMF and clustering with it
* Adaptive Quantum NMF
* Quantum clustering of malware data
